            <p>We are an online platform for discussing workplace related events, issues, and situations. Many times, workday bleeds into our time with family and friends. The work we do provides us with self-fulfillment, a sense of purpose, a feeling of accomplishment, and life goals. However, the workplace is not immune to politics and unsavory situations, though many workplaces have extraordinarily positive cultures. Regardless of how the work culture is and what situations and dynamics we are facing there, it affects our well-being, our relationship with ourselves, and our relationships with our friends and family.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to create a safe and supportive space for individuals to share experiences, seek advice, connect with others, and utilize our resources to navigate their workplace situations. We aim to foster a strong community where people feel heard, understood, and able to openly voice their opinions. Together, we can make this platform a single source for workplace topics.</p>
